/**
 * Watches the network that carries the tunnel and reports topology changes.
 *
 * Cellular -> Wi-Fi is a make-before-break handover: the new network is announced while the old one
 * is still connected, so the socket to the server is never reset and the core keeps using a dead
 * connection. Deciding that a handover happened is what this class is for, acting on it is not.
 *
 * Only used from Android P and above, see CoreServiceManager.startNetworkMonitor().
 * After the debounce window, on a background thread, a handover is first claimed with [claimHandover]
 * while this monitor is registered, under the gate that [unregister] closes first: it has to be short,
 * and once unregister() has returned no handover is claimed. Only a claimed handover goes on to
 * [onHandover], which may block. Both are passed this monitor. [describe] names the run mode and the
 * profile of the service it watches, for its failure logs.
